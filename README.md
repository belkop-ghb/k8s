# Kubernetes - hands-on session

## Prerequisites
* Linux with installed Kubernetes (VM, physical machine, does not matter)
* Command line console with connection to the Kubernetes

You should see something similar in you console:
```sh
user@ubuntu:~$ kubectl get nodes
NAME     STATUS   ROLES    AGE   VERSION
ubuntu   Ready    <none>   22h   v1.20.6-34+e4abae43f6acde
```

## Recomended
* WinSCP or similar software on your local computer - will be used to edit template file in an graphical editor (Notepad++ for example) instead of your console
